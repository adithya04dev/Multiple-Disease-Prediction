Nithin
Our onboarding day was an amazing experience. At first, we were a bit nervous, but thanks to Meghana and Divya, we quickly felt more comfortable. We started with introductions and then jumped into some fun icebreaker activities, like musical chairs. A photo was even taken while we were playing! If someone got out, they had to perform a task—whether it was singing, dancing, or reciting a famous dialogue. I chose to say a dialogue from Baahubali.
After some engaging activities, Santosh, JMM, Padmaja, and Pragathi shared their journeys and experiences in the company, which was really insightful. Then, we enjoyed a wonderful lunch before heading to the big event of the day—laptop distribution and configuration.
Overall, it was a great day filled with fun, learning, and new connections!
Prakash:
My onboarding day was packed with excitement! Though I was a bit late, I made it just in time. Lakshmi, Asha, and Chetan started things off with a fun ball-passing game to break the ice. We then connected with the Hyderabad team, met Santosh and fellow interns, and got introduced to key departments—BTPD, CDO, CIO, and CTX. A surprise quiz kept things lively after all the info dumps.
Lunch was a special treat, followed by laptop setup from the TSI team. Then came the swag—bags, mugs, bottles, caps, books, and pens! We wrapped up with a fun photo session, including one in front of the AT&T logo. The biggest twist was finding out we were joining CIO with zero hints beforehand.And from there, the adventure began!




* 3) Timeline: Deekshita
Welcome everyone, today I'll be walking you through the timeline of our 5-week database course. This track was thoughtfully designed to cover SQL in the first three weeks and MongoDB in the last two weeks, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of both database technologies.


Week 1-3: SQL We started with SQL, dedicating the first three weeks to mastering its concepts. Since many of us were already familiar with SQL, ER diagrams, and normalization, we made good initial progress. To consolidate our learning, Likitha assigned us a practical task at the end of the two-week of SQL track. We were asked to build normalized tables using given columns and to define each of the associated constraints during a meeting.


By the end of the third week, having covered both basic and advanced SQL, Likitha challenged us with a set of questions. We were encouraged to write the queries after discussing them with one another, which greatly enhanced our collaborative learning experience.


Week 4-5: MongoDB In the final two weeks, we shifted our focus to MongoDB. For several of us, MongoDB was new territory, but this made the learning experience even more interesting. We eagerly explored important topics such as indexing and the aggregation pipeline, expanding our understanding of NoSQL databases.


In conclusion, this 5-week journey has been an incredible learning experience. We have grown in our understanding of both SQL and MongoDB, thanks to the dedicated mentorship of Likitha and the strong team collaboration.
* Individual experiences


Prakash:
Hello everyone I'm Prakashgowda, from Bengaluru.Currently I am working on smart launch under Nishi.This project  simplifies the complexities of launching new carriers on air by automating the process.We are using Angular Js for frontend development of the application.After the two presentations done on the telecom basics with both technical and user POV, now we are going ahead with the KT sessions.It is exciting as we are learning along  with the implementation.
Nithin:
Hi everyone, my name is Nithin and I am part of Team Isaac managed by Arpitha. The isaac project is a powerful troubleshooting tool developed for LS support agents & Technicians. At first I didn't understand anything about my project while watching KT because of terminology but my team mentor helped me to understand the acronyms and architecture of the project. Recently I was assigned to learn how to automate the workflows with frameworks like selenium and cucumber. My experience in the organization has been fantastic! I initially thought the corporate world would be strict and serious, but being here completely changed my perspective. It’s actually a fun and engaging place to work, especially with all the activities conducted. While we (men) haven’t had an exclusive event yet, that’s alright. I’m really excited to take part in the Furo Fit Challenge and am looking forward to the cricket tournament!

Moksha:
Hi Everyone I’m Moksha Pradhan from the Bangalore Office. My journey at AT&T has been nothing short of exciting and insightful from the very first day. I loved meeting my fellow interns and connecting with my Manager, Rishi who made settling in feel effortless. One of the most memorable moments was in our third week when we created a video  introducing the CIO Interns for the town hall. Running around the halls of the office looking for the next filming spot, wasn’t just a fun challenge—it became an unexpected way to bond with interns and peers across locations, especially those in Hyderabad.
The DBMS track  across the 5 weeks was a well-structured refresher that proved incredibly useful when I started working on Project VideoNOC under the expert guidance of my mentor, Silka. VideoNOC is all about enhancing the user experience while consuming video content. We work with Event Data Reports (EDRs) to reconstruct video sessions, analyze patterns, and derive insights that drive improvements towards better  streaming experiences.
During my interview with Nagaraj Bhat, I was asked where I see myself in five years. My answer was simple—I wanted to contribute to a real-world project that makes a tangible impact. While I may not be directly contributing a project just yet, I know I’m closer than ever which is why I’m excited to apply everything I’ve learned to make a real difference!


Anisha:
Hi everyone, I am Anisha from the Bangalore office. While I haven’t been officially assigned a project yet, my work revolves around MuleSoft, and my mentor, Lalith has been guiding me through KT sessions and assigned tasks. As part of this, I explored DataWeave  to manipulate and convert data between various formats. My tasks have given me exposure to key integration concepts, including data transformation, API connectivity, database interactions, and error handling, helping me understand how MuleSoft streamlines enterprise integrations.  


Also After Rishi suggested in one of our sync up to look up  Snowflake, I went ahead and completed a hands-on tutorial on the platform. I also had the opportunity to participate in the software symposium of AT&t along with three of my teammates. From brainstorming ideas to drafting a strong abstract and then refining it based on feedback before the next round, the entire process was a valuable learning experience. As part of the DBMS training track, I got to  revisit SQL and MongoDB, strengthening my database skills.


Sanju:
Hello everyone! I am Sanju Sudireddy from Hyderabad. Coming to my experience in AT&T, I came to the office a week after onboarding. On my first day, I was a bit nervous, feeling like I was behind everyone else. However, after arriving at the office, I interacted with my buddy and fellow interns, which helped me feel more comfortable. One good thing was that some seniors took the initiative to talk to us, which made the experience even better.
Later, I was assigned to the database track, for first 2 weeks were a bit easy as we are familiar with SQL. In the third week, we have mongodb which is new one for me and the same week  I was assigned to Project Kepler. We have good interactions with our team. So far, we have had a few KT sessions where we got to know the technologies being used in the project. We were informed that learning Linux would help us better understand the project, so we are currently learning it.


Gayatri:
Hi everyone! I am Gayatri from hyderabad office.In order to share about my experience at AT&T, the first two weeks were spent setting up my laptop, completing the basic PLE courses, and interacting with the seniors and buddies I was assigned to. Then, I was assigned to the database track for five weeks. I felt a little happy as, initially, in the phase of transitioning myself from college to corporate, I was assigned to a somewhat familiar course. There, I gained knowledge over all the topics mentioned in the timeline by Deekshitha.
Simultaneously, I was assigned to the Kepler project. Through the KT (Knowledge Transfer) sessions conducted by the seniors, I learned how the project works and the tools used in it. At first, I was a bit confused by all the new technical terms, but gradually, with the help of the KT sessions, I began to understand them. I also had the opportunity to work with real-time data in the project under the guidance of Manoj. Currently, we are in the phase of learning the Linux system.


Adithya:
Hello  I'm Adithya from the Hyderabad office. I just wanted to share a bit about my experience at AT&T, which has been both enjoyable and educational. I've been assigned to  Light Weight Gateway (LGW) project that acts  as a reverse proxy between users and microservices, essentially managing the load and security.The learning curve was steep initially, especially understanding the technical terminology specific to the project. However, through regular knowledge transfer sessions and the supportive environment fostered by my team, I've grown more confident and comfortable about my project.During my time here, I've had the opportunity to work extensively with React and Material UI for frontend development, node js and MySQL for backend The database track has been particularly valuable as I've applied my knowledge of SQL, PL/SQL, and MongoDB in my project to connect my frontend application to databases.I look forward to contributing more meaningfully to the LGW project in the coming weeks!


 
Deekshita:
Hi everyone, I'm Deekshita from Hyderabad team. Firstly as an intern at AT&T, I've gained invaluable experience not only in Database track, but in the project MCOE which stands for Mobility Center of Excellence, led by Sreevidya the team lead of the project. As far as of my understanding they are working on 11 essential applications helpful for AT&T employees. My tasks assigned upto now were we individually need to demonstrate our proficiency in Springboot, Maven, ReactJS and DBA. 
Overall, these experiences of mine have significantly contributed to my professional growth and understanding of AT&T's dynamic environment. 


* 4) Challenges: Adithya 
While our experience has been largely positive, we encountered a few minor challenges as part of the normal learning process. These included:


We ran into some trouble with the software setup, but fixed it by contacting TSI and checking out a few online resources.
While we knew our way around SQL from college, MongoDB was new territory for us. After spending some time with tutorials and practicing queries, we built up our confidence.
Jumping into real projects was definitely a bit overwhelming at first - there were so many new tools, frameworks, and terms to learn! But after sitting through several knowledge sharing sessions, and asking questions, and spending time with the documentation, things started to click.  Initially what seemed super intimidating before feels pretty manageable, and we're actually getting comfortable with it all.




Overall, these challenges were manageable. Through proper resources and support, we were able to overcome them, continue our progress without major disruption.


* 5) Feedback: Moksha, Prakash, Anisha
Moksha:
Overall, life at AT&T  along with the DBMS track has been a fun yet thoroughly insightful experience. As mentioned in the previous presentation, here’s some feedback that we have. The DBMS track was a well-structured and well thought out course and provided a great all round exposure to databases. However, we think that adding a dedicated lab component or  some small project-based assignments could really help reinforce the theory we learned. Additionally, some real-world case studies—for example how companies handle large-scale data storage and retrieval and what are the challenges they face —would not only offer valuable industry insights but also satisfy our curiosity.
Prakash:
As we progressed, we realized that our initial efforts in creating the CIO Townhall video and presentation didn’t fully meet expectations. With your valuable guidance, we have taken the opportunity to refine and restructure them. With clearer and more precise instructions before in hand, we are confident that we can better align with the 
requirements and deliver as expected.
Anisha: 
Since many of us felt that we already had a basic understanding of SQL, we believe that incorporating some advanced topics—such as window functions, CTEs, and partitioning—could have made the learning experience even more enriching. While we understand that we had the flexibility to explore beyond the provided material, a recommendation to look into these topics would have been really helpful.  Overall, we truly appreciate the effort that went into designing the track and the opportunity to strengthen our database skills.
* 6) Cio town hall: Anisha
We had the opportunity to attend our team's monthly townhall, and the first one was particularly special for us interns. We were given a task to create an introduction video to help the entire team get to know us better. We were given some interesting questions to answer, and collaborating with the Hyderabad interns made the process even more fun. From planning the script to filming the video, it was a great team effort that allowed us to interact and bond.


Since Republic Day was just a few days before the townhall, we were also asked to prepare a song for the celebration. None of us were singers, so practicing together was both challenging and hilarious, but it made the experience even more memorable. During the actual townhall, we got to learn about different team members, their contributions across various projects, and how their work directly impacts AT&T by driving profits. Overall, it was an engaging and insightful session that gave us a deeper understanding of the team's work and culture


* 7) Women's day: Sanju, Gayatri


On the occasion of International Women's Day, the women of AT&T participated in various events organized to celebrate the day. One of these events was Rookie Day, where all the women gathered and interacted with the interns, sharing their experiences. We also engaged in fun activities by forming teams with random people, which helped us interact with women from different units.
The next day, we participated in a tug-of-war event. Similar events also took place in Bangalore, and we learned that two of our interns participated in those activities as well.
These events were not only enjoyable but also provided valuable networking opportunities and a chance to learn from the experiences of other women in the organization




The Women's Day celebration ended with a vibrant talent show, where we all gathered at Capital Land. It was an exciting event, and we actively participated in it. we have several performances of art,dance and singing.The best part was that it gave us an opportunity to grow closer to each other. As a token of appreciation for our participation, we were gifted a voucher. The event concluded with delicious food, making the entire experience even more enjoyable. Additionally Bangalore interns have jewellery making workshop where they used resin and UV light to make beautiful jewellery.








* 8) Interaction with colleagues: Moksha
Our learning isn’t just from projects—it’s also from the amazing people we met. Here are some memorable interactions that made an impact on us.
Top Left: This is Santosh Bijur from the Bangalore office, who was with us on the day of the Tug of War. He shared his experiences in the corporate world, emphasizing the importance of networking in navigating professional life. We also had a great conversation about how living away from home helps us grow as individuals. It was a fun and insightful interaction, especially as he cheered us on during the game!

 Top Right: Meanwhile, while we were busy working, our Hyderabad interns decided to take ‘team bonding’ to the next level—with a trip to Ramoji Film City. They took a break from meetings to explore movie sets, dance in the rain, and turn colleagues into close friends. From what they’ve shared, it sounds like their first office trip was nothing short of a superhit!"
